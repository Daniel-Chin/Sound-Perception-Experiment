# Do Details Make People Buy into Bullshit? 

This Psychology experiment shows the subject two identical pieces of audioclips. 

The subject is first told that they are different. The subject then listens to the clips. The subject is then asked whether they can tell them apart. 

For group A, we simply tell them the clips are different. For group B, we further tell them about the "phase difference in the chord" (which is not true). 

The survey was never distributed because I never approached the IRB.
